# Monster-Fight-Game-With-Java
The monster battle game you're working on involves players managing collections of monsters with attributes like id, name, health, attack, defense, and level. These monsters are stored in a hash table supporting add, remove, and search operations. Players can sort their monsters based on attributes without using a sorting algorithm, selecting monsters for battle. In each battle, the winner gains a level, and the loser is removed from the game. The game concludes when a player loses all their monsters or wins three consecutive battles, with monster data being initialized from a file.
